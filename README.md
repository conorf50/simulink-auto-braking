Advanced Driver Assistance Systems: Assignment Part II (Auto Emergency Braking System in Matlab Simulink)

The model (cfarrell_assign2) models an auto emergency braking system in Simulink


Abstract:
The following documents a simple auto braking system using distance measurement to control a car model and also outlines a benchmark for it to meet. The system measures distance between it (the ‘ego’ vehicle) and the car in front of it (the ‘lead’ vehicle) and calculates both the time to collision and the amount of braking force to apply. There are three levels of braking force which are calculated using a Stateflow controller. It uses examples from MathWorks which can be found in the references at the bottom of this paper as well as the ‘car_model’ from the provided notes
